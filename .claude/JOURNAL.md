1. **Task - Project initialization**: Created new JupyterLab extension `jupyterlab_launcher_navigate_to_kernel_extension` using copier template<br>
    **Result**: Extension scaffolded with standard JupyterLab 4.x structure including TypeScript frontend (`src/index.ts`), Python package (`jupyterlab_launcher_navigate_to_kernel_extension/__init__.py`), GitHub Actions workflows for build/release, Jest and Playwright test infrastructure, and Makefile for build automation. The extension will add context menu options "Show in File Browser" and "Open Terminal at location" when right-clicking kernel launcher buttons. Initial plugin stub activates and logs to console. Package configured with `@jupyterlab/application` v4.0.0 dependency. Git repository initialized with main branch, README updated with badges and brief features documentation.

2. **Task - Full extension implementation**: Implemented complete launcher context menu extension with server-side kernel path resolution<br>
    **Result**: Built a JupyterLab 4.x extension enabling right-click context menus on kernel launcher cards with two commands: "Show in File Browser" and "Open Terminal at Location". The implementation required solving several architectural challenges. First, JupyterLab's launcher cards (`.jp-LauncherCard`) don't natively expose kernel identity through data attributes accessible to context menu commands - the cards only have `data-category` for grouping. Solution: attached a document-level `contextmenu` event listener in capture phase (`src/index.ts:164-178`) that fires before JupyterLab's context menu system, extracting the kernel display name from `.jp-LauncherCard-label` text content and storing it in module-level variable `lastClickedKernelName`. This approach ensures the kernel identity is captured before the command executes. Second challenge: mapping kernel display name to filesystem path. Created Python server extension with REST endpoint `/api/kernel-path/<display_name>` (`handlers.py:14-69`) using `jupyter_client.kernelspec.KernelSpecManager.get_all_specs()` to iterate all kernelspecs and match by `display_name` field. Returns JSON with `kernel_name`, `display_name`, `resource_dir` (kernelspec location), `executable_path` (from `argv[0]`), and computed `env_path`. Third challenge: determining the "useful" path for navigation - users want the environment root, not the kernelspec directory. Implemented `_extract_env_path()` method (`handlers.py:71-133`) with regex pattern matching for: (1) conda environments matching `/envs/name/bin/python` or `/conda/name/bin/python` patterns, (2) base conda installations at `/opt/conda`, `~/miniconda3`, etc., (3) virtualenvs detected by presence of `pyvenv.cfg` file in parent of `bin/`, (4) uv-created environments which follow virtualenv structure, (5) fallback parsing of `/share/jupyter/kernels/` path structure. Frontend path handling (`src/index.ts:70-132`) reuses proven patterns from `jupyterlab_terminal_show_in_file_browser_extension`: `expandTilde()` resolves `~` in server root using regex extraction of home directory from absolute paths, `toRelativePath()` converts absolute filesystem paths to file browser-relative paths with graceful fallback to workspace root when kernel is outside Jupyter's serving directory. Context menu registration uses declarative approach via `schema/plugin.json` with `jupyter.lab.menus.context` array targeting selector `.jp-LauncherCard` at ranks 10 and 11. Added frontend dependencies to `package.json`: `@jupyterlab/filebrowser` (IDefaultFileBrowser for navigation), `@jupyterlab/launcher` (ILauncher interface), `@jupyterlab/terminal` (ITerminalTracker), `@jupyterlab/apputils` (showErrorMessage dialogs), `@jupyterlab/services` (ServerConnection for API calls), `@jupyterlab/coreutils` (URLExt, PageConfig utilities). Backend dependencies in `pyproject.toml`: `jupyter_server>=2.0.0` (APIHandler base class, tornado decorators), `jupyter_client>=8.0.0` (KernelSpecManager). Server extension auto-enablement configured via `jupyter-config/server-config/jupyterlab_launcher_navigate_to_kernel_extension.json` mapped to `etc/jupyter/jupyter_server_config.d/` in wheel shared-data. Extension validated: `jupyter server extension list` shows enabled and OK, `jupyter labextension list` shows v0.1.1 enabled and OK. Kernel path resolution tested programmatically - correctly extracts `/opt/conda` from base Python, `/opt/conda/envs/myenv` from conda environments, and virtualenv roots when `pyvenv.cfg` exists.
